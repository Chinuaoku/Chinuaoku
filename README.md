## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile. Below is a brief summary about myself.

I hold a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I have deep passion for digital technology, cybersecurity, and business development. My expertise lies in leveraging AI-driven software solutions and secure digital infrastructure to build scalable products that drive impact.

As a technical executive at Afiaprime Lab, I co-lead the development of Afiaprime (e-commerce), Cerebrum (medical technology), and AfiaEat (food delivery)â€”platforms designed to bridge critical service gaps in underserved markets. My role encompasses technical strategy, product innovation, cybersecurity, and business scaling, ensuring our platforms remain efficient, secure, and investor-ready.

I am particularly focused on scalable business growth, strategic partnerships, and technology-driven solutions that empower rural and emerging markets. With a strong foundation in cybersecurity and full-stack software development, I bring a holistic approach to digital transformation, ensuring both technological excellence and commercial viability.
